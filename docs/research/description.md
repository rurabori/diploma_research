# Description

+ review existing solutions for SpMV
+ review SpM storage formats (and distribution algos. for parallel version)
+ research possibility of paralelization of SpMV (via OMP, CUDA...)
+ implement OMP version of parallel SpMV
+ benchmark how different SpM structures (banded, diagonal, ...) perform.
+ research possibility of fusing matrix multiplication with vector multiplication (something like FMADD on GPUs).
+ consider optimizations for iterative solvers
(CG, BiCG).
